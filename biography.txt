Iâ€™m Bryan Coba, a Venezuelan 24 years old guy
who is trying to become a frontend developer,
passionate about design, skateboarding, and software development.

I have so many abilities but I'm constantly
dealing with a bunch of stress, anxiety and
imposter syndrome but I'm gonna make it to
success!

My goal is to be financially stable by 30.
